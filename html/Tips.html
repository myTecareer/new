						<h1>How to Write a Computer Science Resume</h1>
					
					<p >For a computer science graduate, writing a resume for a relevant role should be pretty straightforward.

						Whether you're hoping to become a software developer, an IT consultant or a data 
						scientist, you'll need to highlight your most relevant skills and experiences
						and find ways to target the specific job you want throughout your resume
						<span id="dots">...</span>
						<span id="more">
						
						
						1. Set the stage with structure
						The most 
						important thing you can do to start your CS resume journey is to give it clear, logical 
						formatting. You'll want to choose a resume format that helps you highlight your skills 
						and experience and structure your resume around the five key sections: Contact Header,
						Professional Summary, Skills, Work History and Education.
						If you're fresh out of school and you've never held a CS-related job, you 
						might prefer a hybrid or functional resume that emphasizes the skills you 
						developed in your college education.
						But if you held a summer job in an IT department or if you've completed any 
						coding certifications, you may want to opt for a resume format with a
						prominent work history section  — in this case go with the reverse 
						chronological format. 
						2. Pass the gatekeeper
						Many companies use ATS to review resumes before human eyes ever see them.
						To make sure your computer science student resume gets past this bot, 
						avoid graphics, logos and tables, and stick with standard fonts.
						Study the job description closely and use language directly from the 
						posting whenever it's relevant. Avoid abbreviations and slang, as you
						never know how sensitive the ATS's filters are. For instance, if the 
						posting asks for candidates with experience in Artificial Intelligence,
						use the full term, not "AI," in your resume.
						3. Show that you're special
						Your resume's education section will tell recruiters that you completed a 
						computer science major with any concentrations or specializations you may have 
						achieved. If you attended a larger university with a well-developed computer science
						department or had internships or other on-the-job work, you might have
						had the opportunity to build skills and experience in some of the most
						common CS specializations:
						Computer and network security
						Mobile and web computing
						Software engineering
						Bioinformatics
						Data analytics
						Artificial intelligence
						If you chose a specialization, make sure to note it front and center so the hiring manager
						 can see it. If your school didn't offer formal specializations, feel free to indicate the
						 specializations that interest you the most, especially if you found a way to incorporate 
						 them into your studies. Highlighting your unique skillset and interests will help differe
						 ntiate you from your fellow computer science graduates.

						<h1>Setting Goals To Improve Your Career</h1>
					
					<p>Setting specific, measurable goals can provide a path to improve your career and achieve certain accom
					plishments. You can use goal setting when given a certain task or project, or to personally advance in so
					me way. You can set goals towards promotions, creativity, education and many other various ways to improv
					e your life and career.Let’s look at why setting goals can help improve your career, what types of goals
					you can set and how to set goals
					<span id="dots2">...</span>
						<span id="more2">
					Why setting goals is important
					Setting goals is important because it gives you a framework to achieve milestones. Wanting to do or co
					mplete certain things in life is a great start. Goal setting provides a path for you to actually do them
					. There are two types of goals you should consider setting: short term and long term.
					What are the short-term goals?
					Short-term goals are more immediate goals you set for yourself to achieve your larger, long-term goals.
					You can think of short-term goals as milestones or stepping stones. Short-term goals usually exist in a s
					hort timeframe, anywhere from days or months to one or two years. Examples of short-term goals might incl
					ude completing small tasks or projects, gaining experience or taking classes. You will use what you accom
					plished in the short term to complete your long-term goals.
					What are long-term goals?
					ong-term goals are usually large goals you want to achieve over several years. You will use several m
					ilestones to achieve long-term goals, setting short-term goals to achieve along the way. Long-term goals 
					might include getting a job in a certain career, being promoted to a certain level or completing a length
					y, complicated project.
					etting personal goals
					Setting goals for your personal life will help you reach personal achievements. You might set persona
					l goals to advance several categories in your life for things like hobbies, health or education. Setting
					personal goals can help you achieve success in your career as well.
					Advancing your interests by building experience in hobbies you enjoy or skills you want to improve can
					easily transfer into your professional life. These are often good things to include on your resume if 
					relevant to the jobs you’re applying for. Spending time improving on things you want in your personal 
					life can also help you be more focused and energetic at work by paying attention to your work-life balance

					<h1>How to Become a Web Developer</h1>
					
					<p>Not too long ago, the person in charge of a company's website was called the webmaster. This magical p
					erson could conjure up a website using basic HTML coding skills ― a quaint idea in today's complicated mix
					of programming languages and CMS platforms.Webmasters have been replaced by a team of specialists who can
					handle the complexity that the modern web requires. Today, many websites need a variety of these experts:
					front-end developers, back-end developers, UX designers
					<span id="dots3">...</span>
						<span id="more3">
					content strategists and full stack developers ov
					erseeing its design, programming, integrations and maintenance. In today's work environment, web develop
					er requirements include creativity, technical skills and project management expertise. No matter your dir
					ection, the outlook for web developers is positive — the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 15 percent j
					ob growth for the field. The trick to succeeding in the field is staying agile, and on top of trends, so 
					you can adjust as new technology disrupts the industry. Here's how to leverage your coursework and skills 
					to land that first job as a web developer
					
					1. Front-end developer
					A front-end developer knows HTML, CSS, DOM and JavaScript. They can also write code to create the use
					r-end of a website, which means they understand user experience (UX) design and have other software too
					ls at their disposal like Node.js and React. Front-end developers work directly with clients and design
					ers to come up with the look and style of a website. Two great resources for front-end developers are FE
					DS on Slack and the Front End Developer Handbook. 
					2. Back-end developer
					A back-end developer delves more deeply into the site's functionality, creating the database and a
					lgorithms needed to make the site function properly. For instance, while a front-end developer will c
					reate a form on the website for inputting names and email addresses, the back-end developer will give 
					that information a function. Back-end developers also earn higher salaries due to their proficiency wit
					h advanced languages like:C++PHP Python JavaRuby
					3. Full-stack developer
					This highly desired employee is skilled in a variety of languages and applications, from user experie
					nce to DevOps, and can bring those skills into play when working on a project. The full-stack developer 
					is a jack of all trades, agile enough to move through the process and pull in tools as needed to get a
					website up and running. This position is the embodiment of the "move fast and break things" ethos and is
					best suited for the hacker type who is willing to learn everything and isn't afraid of cracking open the 
					code to see how things work. 
					4. Other types of web development
					As the web has matured, so have the languages and tools used to create websites. Open source CMS platf
					orms and frameworks allow developers to build upon the basics without having to code from scratch. For in
					stance, Keystone.js provides a database framework to build upon.   Examples of other open source CMS fra
					meworks include:WordPressDrupal JoomlaMagento
					Some developers utilize these platforms to create solutions quickly for clients — especially clients who
					can't afford to employ a web development team and will have to update and maintain their own website.For 
					clients like these, some web developers have found that specializing in closed-source platforms, like Sho
					pify (e-commerce) or HubSpot (inbound marketing), can prove a smart career choice.
					Technology is moving forward rapidly. Today it's blockchain, the Internet of Things and AI that are di
					srupting business — in a year, it may be all about data analysis. It's a web developer's job to stay curr
					ent on developments in the industry and keep looking ahead.To create a resume that will set you apart 
					from the competition and show off your forward-thinking skillset, check out our Resume Builder. When you
					're ready to apply for a specific job, our Cover Letter Builder helps you write a letter that conveys yo
					ur expertise and passion and catches a hiring manager's eye.
